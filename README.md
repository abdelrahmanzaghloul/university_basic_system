# university_basic_system

The system describes a simple basic database for online international universities. It can be used and embedded as a sample model to use in different ways. The system registers the employees, their full names, their gender, their hiring date and their office. There are many offices for the university around the world and there are number of employees in each office. The office has a phone number, detailed address, state and postal code. The system also considers the start date and the end date to calculate the salary. There are number of departments in the university and the employees are divided in these departments. There is a manager for each department. There is a unique ID for each department. The system starts by creating the required offices then creating the needed departments. As I explained, each department and office has their unique ID. The system then adds the employeesâ€™ data in the employee table. The system will require to add the department manager and department employees. We go to the table of managers and add using the employee id and department id, we choose who will be the manager. We then go to the table of department employees and again using employee id and department id, we determine which employee will be in which department.
